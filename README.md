# journal

This is (going to be) a simple electron app where I can keep journal entries. I hope to support:

* reactjs
* markdown entries w/a markdown parser
* image and video support
* tagging support
* cloud saving (back up entries to dropbox)

## development

`$ yarn run start`
`$ yarn run electron-start`
